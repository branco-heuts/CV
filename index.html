								<p>Environmental stimuli often lead to heterogeneous cellular responses and transcriptional output. We developed single-cell RNA and Immunodetection (RAID) to allow combined analysis of the transcriptome and intracellular (phospho-)proteins from fixed single cells. RAID successfully recapitulated differentiation-state changes at the protein and mRNA level in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, we show that differentiated keratinocytes that retain high phosphorylated FAK levels, a feature associated with stem cells, also express a selection of stem cell associated transcripts. Our data demonstrates that RAID allows investigation of heterogeneous cellular responses to environmental signals at the mRNA and phospho-proteome level.</p>

								<p class="authors">Esther Tijchon, Guoqiang Yi,Amit Mandoli, Jos G. A. Smits, Francesco Ferrari, <strong><u>Branco M. H. Heuts</u></strong>, Falco Wijnen,Bowon Kim, Eva M. Janssen-Megens, Jan Jacob Schuringa, Joost H. A. Martens.</p>
								<p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent mutations that affect normal hematopoiesis. The analysis of human AMLs has mostly been performed using end-point materials, such as cell lines and patient derived AMLs that also carry additional contributing mutations. The molecular effects of a single oncogenic hit, such as expression of the AML associated oncoprotein AML1-ETO on hematopoietic development and transformation into a (pre-) leukemic state still needs further investigation. Here we describe the development and characterization of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system that allows in vitro differentiation towards different mature myeloid cell types such as monocytes and granulocytes. During in vitro differentiation we expressed the AML1-ETO fusion protein and examined the effects of the oncoprotein on differentiation and the underlying alterations in the gene program at 8 different time points. Our analysis revealed that AML1-ETO as a single oncogenic hit in a non-mutated background blocks granulocytic differentiation, deregulates the gene program via altering the acetylome of the differentiating granulocytic cells, and induces t(8;21) AML associated leukemic characteristics. Together, these results reveal that inducible oncogene expression during in vitro differentiation of iPS cells provides a valuable platform for analysis of aberrant regulation in disease.</p>

						<h4>PhD Molecular Mechanisms of MLL-rearranged Acute Myeloid Leukemia</h4>
						<p>Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science (RIMLS) <br> 2019 - 2023</p>
					</header>
						<p>I am invested in researching MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer that is prominent in children.
							In particular, I research the t(9;11) subtype, which is often known as MLL-AF9 AMLs.
							During the years as researcher I have developed, amongst other this, a novel computational method to predict novel DNA-binding proteins using solely transcriptional data (CAGE-seq).
							Also, I researched a novel induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model system that allows for controlled MLL-AF9 expression, enabling us to study the pre-leukemic events of pediatric leukemia.
							My work has led to the identification of a novel key transcription factor in pediatric AMLs that has potential for targeted therapy.
							During this time I also supervised and educated eight students, which I was happy to work with.
							I have developed a strong interest in bioinformatics, in particular Python development.</p>

						<h4>Internship Molecular Biology</h4>
						<p>Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science (RIMLS) <br> 6 months</p>
					</header>
						<p>I performed various Next Generation Sequencing techniques in order to research the leukemic cell line NOMO1.
							Here, we were interested in an abnormal intragenic transcription start site that is associated with a superior prognosis in pediatric patients.
							NOMO1 functions as a model system to study this molecular phenomenon.
							In six months I learned RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNA transfection, DNA electroporation, cell culture,
							and relevant data analysis using Bash and R, such as quality control, mapping, differential expression analysis,
							peak calling, and transcription factor motif prediction.</p>

						<h4>Internship Molecular Developmental Biology</h4>
						<p>Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science (RIMLS) <br> 6 months</p>
					</header>
						<p>I executed the first successful single cell transcriptome and intracellular (phospho-)proteins extraction experiment using RAID-seq.
							Subsequently, I helped analyse the data and we were able to push a manuscript to a higher impact factor.
							The techniques I learned during these six months were: PCR, Immunoprecipitation, Western blot, cell culture,
							RAID protocol (CEL-Seq2), IC-Western, qPCR, and data analysis using R (Seurat, Monocle, goseq).</p>

								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 15px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not focussing on my career I like to work with music. Together with a good mate of mine, we are asked to perform as DJs.
									We have a residency at the biggest student party of Nijmegen, where we entertain more than 1.000 people per event.
									We like to bring some refreshing and new music to the stage, while still giving the sound that people know and love.
									It's always a thrill to go on stage, such a rewarding experience to be having fun with my good mate. <br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides that, I have a curious mind, I tend to keep finding subjects to learn about. That is also how my DJ hobby and my love for Python development started.</p>
